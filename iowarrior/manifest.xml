  <description brief="iowarrior">
    A driver for the iowarrior attached to TASER's usb port. It requires the iowarrior kernel
    module to be loaded. It uses the included iowarrior-sdk to offer the get_power and
    set_power services. You can pass either the power-socket-number (0-7 for the first and
    only port on our iowarrior 24) or a device name to both calls for getting/setting power.
    You can also use the special name "all" to set all sockets on or off.
     
    The socket names (and what power-sockets they map to) are defined in parameters.yaml, so
    make sure to
     
      rosparam load parameters.yaml
      
    before you start.
