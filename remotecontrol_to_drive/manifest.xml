  <description brief="remotecontrol_to_drive">

    A driver for the remotecontrol receiver attached to the can-io-board on TASER's right side.
    This node publishes values between -1 (left, reverse) and 1.0 (forward, right) with 20Hz on
    the topic "remotecontrol_values".

    Make sure to rotate the "Steering D/R" wheel to the very front of the sender, else the
    steering amplitude will be too small.

    Employs the NET_DEV-variant of the peak-system pcan-dongle driver and the linux can-
    socket network stack to talk to the CAN-IO-board, to which the rc-receiver is connected.
