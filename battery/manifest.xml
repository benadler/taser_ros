  <description brief="battery">

    A driver for TASER's main battery. Publishes the voltage on the battery_voltage topic
    at 0.1 Hz and also offers a service named get_voltage.

    Employs the NET_DEV-variant of the peak-system pcan-dongle driver and the linux can-
    socket network stack to talk to the CAN-IO-board, to which the battery-voltmeter is
    connected.
